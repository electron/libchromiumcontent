Several services require "app" capability from all other services
(wildcard), which is in itself probably a Bad Thing; but it's
especially bad now because the catalog service exposes module
directory access through its app capability.

This changes the catalog manifest to move the capability to a
different more specific capability, and updates two of its
consumers.
